Making an LED blink with Arduino!

Hardware Used
- Elegoo UNO R3
- Breadboard
- 1 x LED
- 1 x 220 Ohm Resistor
- Jumper Wires

Circuit Diagram
LED is connected to pin 13 with a resistor in series
- pin 13 -> resistor -> LED(Anode)
- LED(cathode) -> GND

How To Run
- Connect the components as described above
-  Open Arduino IDE and copy-paste the code into a new sketch
-  Upload the code and the LED will blink ON for 1 second, OFF for 1 second.

What I Learned
- Basics of setting up an Arduino project
- Using pinMode() to configure GPIO
- Controlling digital outputs with digitalWrite()
- Introducing timing using delay()
