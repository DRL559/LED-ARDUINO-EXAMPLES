# Button-Led
Making an LED on and off with a push button using Arduino

# Hardware Used
- Elegoo UNO R3
- Breadboard
- 1 x LED
- 1 x 220 Ohm Resistor
- 1 x Push Button
- Jumper Wires

# Circuit Diagram
- 5v -> resistor -> button pin 3
- GND -> Button pin 4
- button pin 1 -> led (+)
- led (-) -> GND

# How To Run
- Connect the components as described above

# What I Learned
- Buttons act as digital inputs (HIGH/LOW)
- Simple input â†’ output control is the basis for interactive circuits.
